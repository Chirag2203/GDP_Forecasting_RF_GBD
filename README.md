# GDP_Forecasting_RF_GBD
In this project I have tried to predict the GDP for various countries using RF and GB models.<br/>

Linear Regression is also used but the accuracy achieved is very low because of lot many parameters.<br/>
To have a visual look and use the model follow the following commands-<br/>

1)Download the RF_GBM.py file <br/>
2)Run in VScode/terminal or any other IDE<br/>
3)Type the following command in terminal to install streamlit and then run it.<br/>
  pip install streamlit <br/>
  streamlit run RF_GBM.py<br/>
  This will Initialise the streamlit and a new window will open in your browser<br/>
 4) Enter the values asked for and click predict.<br/>
 5) Now you can see the predicted values of GDP-Per capita for that data<br/>
