# GDP_Forecasting_RF_GBD
In this project I have tried to predict the GDP for various countries using RF and GB models.

Linear Regression is also used but the accuracy achieved is very low because of lot many parameters.
To have a visual look and use the model follow the following commands-

1)Download the RF_GBM.py file
2)Run in VScode/terminal or any other IDE
3)Type the following command in terminal to install streamlit and then run it.
  pip install streamlit 
  streamlit run RF_GBM.py
  This will Initialise the streamlit and a new window will open in your browser
 4) Enter the values asked for and click predict.
 5) Now you can see the predicted values of GDP-Per capita for that data
